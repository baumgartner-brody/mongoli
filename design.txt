Big TODO: Change the way the color implementations work to be consistent with the windows coloring scheme 0x00 = BLACK BLACK 0x 0f = BLACK WHITE, etc.

Devise some sort of special character to allow for multi-colored strings 

 White text + red value + white text 

This may require a rework of EntityString to make each character associate with its own color value 
This will effectively make every character a 16-bit short int as opposed to an 8-bit int 

Instead of converting every 8 bit char to a 16 bit one, a special delimeter should be used to signal control codes to entitystrings
Something like 

^^ - ^
^c - change color
^k - randomize text 
etc.
