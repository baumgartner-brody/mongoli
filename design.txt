Devise some sort of special character to allow for multi-colored strings 

 White text + red value + white text 

This may require a rework of EntityString to make each character associate with its own color value 
This will effectively make every character a 16-bit short int as opposed to an 8-bit int 

Instead of converting every 8 bit char to a 16 bit one, a special delimeter should be used to signal control codes to entitystrings
Something like 

^ - delimeter (any arbitrary character would work)
^^ - ^
^c - change color
^k - randomize text 
etc.

Should start leaning towards strings that support the extended ascii code.

typedef basic_string<unsigned char> ustring; 

9-23-2022: The user's folder will also contain a file that stores the date of the last time they opened that folder
  The worlds will be listed in reverse chronological order when displaying
  The version number the world was last opened on will also need to be tracked, in case some sort of compatability conversion needs to happen.

9-17-2022: The user's folder worldname will be the timestamp that it was created, and the display name will be held in an internal file.

9-16-2022: TODO The user should be allowed to click and select multiple letters when typing, so all letters will need to be converted to a Uint8 as the user types them.
  Per the above, an arbitrary value will be chosen to be a delimeter.
  The letters will therefore need to have hitboxes.

TODO: With the multi-colored strings, announcements will need to be 
  Note: Extended ascii chars such as 'â˜º' may need to be copied from a hex editor, 
	as typing them directly does not always choose the right number.

Main menu design and opening:
  The user gets some sort of cutscene (way down the road)
  The user enters the main menu with 4 options
  These options are centered based on an arbitray X value,
  and the option to load a save world is only shown if saves exist in the directory

UI and player menu design:
  List of things the player needs to know:
    Health
    Hunger
    Hotbar
    Inventory

    What they are looking at (entity/container/map object)

Add a method of centering text for TextManager, and clean up freeKeyboardEnable (with blinking cursor)
